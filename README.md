# Project-Apex-Retail-Sales-Customer-Analytics in PowerBI

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a retail sales dataset, designed to uncover key business insights and demonstrate a full-cycle data analysis workflow. The primary goal was to transform raw sales data into an interactive, two-part business intelligence report that empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

The entire project, from data cleaning and modeling to the final interactive dashboards, was completed using **Microsoft Power BI** and its integrated tools (Power Query and DAX).

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)

Before analysis, the raw data required significant cleaning and transformation. The following steps were performed in Power Query:

* **Data Type Correction:** Ensured all columns were in the correct format (e.g., `ORDERDATE` converted from Text to Date using Locale).
* **Handling Missing Values:** Filled `null` values in `STATE` and `POSTALCODE` by creating a lookup table from existing valid data and merging queries.
* **Column Creation & Transformation:**
    * Concatenated `CONTACTFIRSTNAME` and `CONTACTLASTNAME` into a `ContactFullName` column.
    * Created a `Cleaned Phone` column by stripping non-numeric characters and enforcing a 10-digit length rule, setting others to null.

## Data Modeling & DAX

A robust data model was created to support time-based analysis and complex calculations.

* **Date Table:** A dynamic calendar table was created using the `CALENDARAUTO()` DAX function. This table was marked as the official date table and was used for all time-based visuals and calculations.
* **Relationships:** A one-to-many relationship was established between the `Date Table` and the `sales_data` table.
* **DAX Measures:** Several key measures were written to power the visuals, including:
    * `Total Sales`, `Total Orders`, `AOV`
    * An advanced **`YoY Sales Growth %`** measure using `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` to provide critical business context.
